
FIXES & IMPROVEMENTS
--------------------

FUNCTIONALITY FIXES  
--------------------

1. ✅ Enabled autoplay for videos in Chrome  
- Added `video.muted = true` in `createVideo()` to meet browser autoplay policies.

2. ✅ Fixed annotation cycling not resuming  
- Changed `handleAnnotationFocus` to always call `startCycleTimeout(...)` to resume cycling after 45s of inactivity, regardless of `AppState.cycling`.

3. ✅ Fixed off-by-one error in `cycleAnnotations`  
- Corrected logic:  
  `if (currentIndex >= annLength) currentIndex = 0;`

4. ✅ Replaced `window` globals with `AppState` module  
- `AppState` now holds:  
  ```
  export const AppState = {
    cycling: true,
    restartTimer: null
  };
  ```

BEHAVIORAL FIXES  
------------------

5. ✅ Camera movement now stops cycling  
- Updated `camerastart` event handler in `main.js`:  
  ```
  AppState.cycling = false;
  autoplay = false;
  startCycleTimeout(...);
  ```

6. ✅ Cycling restarts after 45 seconds of no interaction  
- Ensured `startCycleTimeout()` is called even after annotation focus, preventing stalls.

CODE CLEANUP & STANDARDIZATION  
-------------------------------

7. ✅ Refactored `removeVideo()`  
- Switched from `setInterval()` to `setTimeout()` for one-time delayed cleanup.

8. ✅ Renamed `message` to `index` in `videoAnnotationEnded` events  
- Improved clarity and accuracy of custom event detail.

9. ✅ Simplified and combined `.classList.add()` calls  
- Example:  
  `classList.add('video-modal', 'video-out');`
